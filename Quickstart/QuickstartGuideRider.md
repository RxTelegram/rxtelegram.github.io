# Quickstart Guide (Rider)

Hey ðŸ‘‹,
thanks for your interested in using [RxTelegram.Bot](https://github.com/RxTelegram/RxTelegram.Bot). This quickstart guide will give you an easy 3 steps solution how to get started with RxTelegram.Bot using your Terminal. __Quickstart guides are also available for the Terminal and Visual Studio.__

## 1. Bot Father

Before we can get started you need to create a Telegram Bot by visiting [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) with any Telegram client and create a new bot. He will give you an access token which you need to authorize your bot at every request, but do not worry we will handle this for you.
