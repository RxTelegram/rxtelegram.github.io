## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Bot Token

```text
Unhandled exception. RxTelegram.Bot.Exceptions.InvalidTokenException: The given bot token is not valid. See "https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#authorizing-your-bot" for further information. Token was: ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
   at RxTelegram.Bot.BotInfo.ValidateToken(String token)
   at RxTelegram.Bot.BotInfo..ctor(String token)
   at RxTelegram.Bot.TelegramBot..ctor(String token)
   at Awesome.Program.Main() in C:\Users\nikwe\Downloads\asf\Program.cs:line 7
```

If you get an Exception like this it is most likely that you did not replaced the access token in the code sample or you copied the wrong one.
